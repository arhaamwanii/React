TEMPLATE LITERALS 

- they can be creates using   ``
-it is a way to work with  strings
-Combining strings using template literals = 
    >`` you have to put the whole content in backticks
    > ${} using this the variable or the text can be specified
            let name1 = prompt("You first name");
            let name2 = prompt("Your last name");

            let fullName = `${name1} ${name2}`

            document.getElementById("example").innerHTML = fullName;

STRUCTURING OBJECTS

-it is used to bind values from the objects to a Variable
       -const me = { 
            name: "arham",
            age: "17 year and 3 month ",
            ability: "obsession",
        }

        const {name, age , ability } = me;

        let all = (`${name}  ${age}  ${ability}` )

        document.getElementById("heading").innerHTML = all ;

        console.log(all);

-const{name , age , ability} = me;
-this is used to to name the variables to be used outside as well - "name: hello" this can be used to reaname the thing outside the object 


DESTRUCTURING ARRAYS

you are basically making variable and a array at the same time time  

    let [one , two , three , four , five ] = ['arham' , 23 , "amin" , "wani" , "12342342"];

OBJECT LITERALS
-



FOR OF 
-it is basically used to loop of the whole thing, and see the value individually

    let  full = [200 , 600 , 400];

    for ( const text of full){
        console.log(text);
    }
